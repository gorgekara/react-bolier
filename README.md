## About

Blank React.js project setup with Webpack, Babel (ES6) and SCSS.

## Quick start

Install all requirements by running `npm install`. Before you run the command make sure you have Node.js > 4.5 installed.
After installation run `npm run watch` to start watching the project (run in in dev mode). To create a minified (uglify) version of the code run `npm run build`. It will minify the JavaScript bundle and reduce it's size substantionaly.

Webpack & webpack dev server are installed locally and are started when the commands above are run.

*Please note: Boilerplate is still work in progress.*
